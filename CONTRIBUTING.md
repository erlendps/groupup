# Contributing to GroupUp

Guidelines for contributing to the GroupUp repo.

## Submitting Pull Requests

- **DO** ensure submissions pass all GitLab pipelines legs and are merge conflict free.
- **DO** follow the [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) settings for each directory. 
- **DO NOT** write non-english commit messages, dicussions, issues, etc. This makes the code history portable, and allows the product owner to replace us with ease.
- **DO** submit issues for other features. This facilitates discussion of a feature separately from its implementation, and increases the acceptance rates for pull requests.
- **DO NOT** submit large code formatting changes without consulting the other group members first.
- **DO** utilize pair programming whenever possible. Remember that everyone should pair up at least once during the course of the semester. Reach out to the others on Slack!
- **DO** [*Ask for help and input early, and magically, you will find your code getting "pulled" (merged) on schedule.*](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) - Ilya Grigorik.

## Creating Issues

- **DO** use a descriptive title that identifies the issue to be addressed or the requested feature. For example, when describing an issue where the app is not behaving as expected, write your bug title in terms of what the app should do rather than what it is doing – “User page should return an error when Xyz is used in Abcd.”
- **DO** specify a detailed description of the issue or requested feature.
- **DO** describe the expected behavior and the actual behavior when creating a bug report. If it is not self-evident such as in the case of a crash, provide an explanation for why the expected behavior is expected.
- **DO** subscribe to notifications for the created issue in case there are any follow up questions (e.g., email notifications to stud@xxx.ntnu.no)..

## Coding Style

The project uses [Pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) to ensure consistent code style. The repo also includes [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org) files to help enforce this convention.  Contributors should ensure they follow these guidelines when making submissions. 

### Python

- **DO NOT** ignore the styleguide provided by `pycodestyle`
